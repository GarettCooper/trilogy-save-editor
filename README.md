# Trilogy Save Editor
A save editor for Mass Effect Trilogy

## A bit late but just in time !
This software is similar to Gibbed's save editors (and forks) but adds a lot of stuff.

- Mass Effect 1 (yay!) with about a hundred plots.
- A lot of new plots for ME2/3 (including N7 and DLC Weapons)
- Some fixes (ME2 Squad appearance)
- Free (as freedom) and open-source software with [CeCILL license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeCILL)

The goal was to have an editor for all 3 games before the Legendary Edition was released. That's done.

I spent days digging into their code to figure out how to parse Unreal files (for ME1) and saves from ME2/3. Without them I could not have done anything.
